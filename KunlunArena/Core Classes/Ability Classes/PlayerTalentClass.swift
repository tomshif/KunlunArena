// This is the base class for all player talents and abilities, from the simplest melee attack to the most complicated special move.
//
// Subclasses of this class should be completely self-contained, meaning that they will perform all checks for what entities are hit by attacks, modify player attributes, create and remove child nodes for special effects, etc.
//
// Only the init(), getCoolDown(), updateTalent() and the doTalent() functions should be exposed, all others should be internal or private.
//
// doTalent() should contain all code necessary to carry out the talent.
//
// PlayerClass will handle checking the active talents and removing active talents that need to be removed.
