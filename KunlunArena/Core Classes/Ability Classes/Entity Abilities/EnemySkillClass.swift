// This class will serve as the base class for all enemy talents/abilities/skills/attacks/etc.
// Anything other than move that enemies do should be contained in a child class of this class.
// It will work very similar to the PlayerTalentClasses where entities will have an array of known skills and then choose (intelligently) from that list based on a prioritized list, cooldowns and situations.
// Entities will also have a list of active skills, similiar to the PlayerClass, but unlike the PlayerClass, active skills will be removed by the entity intead of the GameScene.
