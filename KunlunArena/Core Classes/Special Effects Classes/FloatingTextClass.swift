// This class is to allow us to easily create floating text as visual indicators for things such as damage or healing done, status effects being applied, etc).
// Essentially it will create a small SKLabel of a certain color that drifts up from the target location and fades out.
// The initializers will allow creation of the floating text on the player or an entity.
