// These are used in the creation of random inventory items.
//
// Prime numbers are used for each of effect so that we know that the product of these numbers will only be evenly divisible by those prime numbers.
// For example, if we Wisdom and Health on a piece of equipment, we multiple the 3 and the 5 to get 15. If we divide (modulus) by 3 and 5, we get a remainder of 0, but if we divide (mod) by any of the other prime numbers, we get a non-zero remainder. So we can easily figure out which effects are on the equipment.
